\section{Introduction}
    \subsection{Purpose}
      \begin{flushleft}
        The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the requirements for the Project Management System. It will explain the purpose and features of the system, as well as system constraints. This document is intended to be proposed to University of Pretoria lecturers and the KPMG the project owner, as well as a reference for developing the first version of the project management system.
      \end{flushleft}
 
  \subsection{Scope}
      \begin{flushleft}
        KPMG currently have a web based project management system named EMS which handles allocation and management of assigned projects for all employees and project managers.The current system does not cover the spectrum of requirements that they demand. They require further functionality from the system and they wish to control more business needs and communication through a single portal. The client needs require us to create a new design of their current system and an update of their current interface.
        \linebreak
        \linebreak
        KPMG's project management system will be a web based application that allows for the creation and management of projects. It will handle a notification system for notification requests and notification acknowledgements and and per-user calendar overview to display all current project information currently assigned to that user. For all projects currently administered, the system is also required to display client Location and direction information to the employees assigned to the project.
        \linebreak
        \linebreak
        KPMG's project management system will further require Microsoft Outlook integration in the form of a toolbar to be created for Microsoft Outlook which manages the chain of responsibility for notification requests and notification acknowledgements.
      \end{flushleft}


\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
\subsubsection{System interfaces}
TBA
\subsubsection{User interfaces}
A web application will be available for the employee to interact with, as well as a quick response feature that will be provided in Outlook.
\subsubsection{Hardware interfaces}
N/A
\subsubsection{Software interfaces}
Our system will run on a Microsoft environment. 
\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
Outlook will be the medium through which the user will interact and receive notifications. The protocols used will be HTTP/S with addition to SMTP/POP3/IMAP. Futhermore, communication will be encapsulated by Outlook's API.
\subsubsection{Memory}
For our system we will be using a MongoDB cluster, that will be hosted on a NodeJS server.

		\item \textbf{FR2.4}: A manager will be allowed to remove a project from the system, pending director approval
		
		\item \textbf{FR2.5}: A project manager will be able to view all projects that they are managing
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{FR3: System Functions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{FR3.1}: The system will assign employees to a project based
		on their skill level and past project experience. 
		
		\item \textbf{FR3.2}: The system will find all the employees that have the required skills     for the job and give it to the manager as a recommendation.

		\item \textbf{FR3.4}: Employee data with skills and past work experience
		will be entered on the system and updated after each project. 
		
		\item \textbf{FR3.5}: System will reassign another employee, pending 
		approval, if an employee takes leave during the project.
		
		\item \textbf{FR3.6}: Every employee that is assigned to a project will get
		the full project duration and details on their calendar. 
		
		\item \textbf{FR3.7}: The system should be able to provide the location of and direction      to the client to all employees assigned to the respective project

		\item \textbf{FR3.9}: The system will preload all employees training dates at the beginning of the year.
	\end{itemize}
	

\subsection{Non Functional Requirements}
 \begin{itemize}
	\item Color Scheme - There will have to be a pleasing colour scheme for           the system, one that represents the colours of KPMG
	
	\item Security - The system will have to cater for employee and client            security, There will have to be measures put into place to prevent         the database and server falling prey to malicious attacks.
	 
	\item Performance - The system will have to manage many users at the same         time, mostly based on the number of employees stationed at the            Pretoria branch
	
	\item Concurrency - The system will have to support multiple users at the         same time
	
	\item Scalability - The system will have to be able to adapt to a larger          environment and expand beyond its normal scope of function
\end{itemize}
	
\subsection{Architectural Requirements}

\begin{paragraph}
        The system will be designed using the n-tier architecture (Specifically 3-tier), where the system is divided into three layers}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 1. Presentation Layer
            \item 2. Application Layer
            \item 3. Data Layer
        \end{itemize}
         Each layer will be modifiable without having to change the entire application. As a result of the aforementioned, maintenance and adding extra functionality is easier. Overall complexity of code over all layers will be reduced thus making the layers reusable in other applications.By using this architecture system will allow the different members in our teams to modify different layers without interference. It is possible to deploy each layer (Specifically the data and application layers) over multiple different locations for better reliability and performance.
\end{paragraph}
 
  
  \subsubsection{Presentation Layer}
    \begin{paragraph}
       This is the layer the user will be interacting with. It encompasses the actual apps (Android, iOS and web), and any interactions that the users have with them.     
    \end{paragraph}
    \textbf{The presentation layer include:  }
      \begin{itemize}
        \item What to display and when to display it, itâ€™s the logic behind the webpages and the control between access from one to another.
      \end{itemize}
  
  \subsubsection{Application Layer}
    \begin{paragraph}
        The application layer contains all the business logic of the system - it makes logical decisions based on the interactions from the presentation layer and the data from the data layer.    
    \end{paragraph}

    \textbf{The decisions made by this layer include:}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Allow admin users to be able to add/ remove client projects and assign these to employees who will be working on these projects.
            \item Automatically update calendars of the employees.
            \item Crosscheck projects before assigning projects to an employee.
            \item Server communication over the internet.
            \item Scheduling Assistant calculations. 
            \item Limit an employee from being able to edit the projects that have been prepopulated.
            \item Allow an employee  to add other events to his/ her calendar if these do not clash with the prepopulated events.
            \item Session management.
          \end{itemize}
  
  \subsubsection{Data Layer}
    \textbf{The data layer is where the data and information used by the application layer is stored. This information includes:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Recommended time slots where all employees are available. 
        \item Server storage with mongodb
        \item View individual employee calendar and assigned projects. 
    \end{itemize}
